# **Background** 
The World Happiness Report has reviewed the state of happiness across the world since 2011. The report makes use of life evaluations from Gallup World Poll data which provide the basis of the happiness rankings. Life evaluation questions are assessed using the Cantril ladder, which asks respondents to think of a ladder where 10 is the best possible life, and 0 is the worst possible life. Six variables are used to explain the variation in happiness levels across the countries. These include GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption. 

## **What Makes Us Happy?**
The common expression 'money can't buy happiness' has been around for centuries and is a widely accepted notion, but is this true? What if you are living paycheck to paycheck? In this case, winning the lottery would relieve stress and inevitably increase happiness. So, does this imply that this statement is wrong? 

This project aims to visualise global happiness ratings, as well as average national income per capita, to assess if there is a relationship between the two variables. 

## **Research Questions**
Aims of this data visualisation:

1. Which countries are the happiest and the least happy?
2. How has happiness changed over the last 10 years?
3. Which countries are the richest and the poorest based on average national income per capita?
4. Is there a relationship between average income and overall happiness?

## **Data Origins** 
Happiness data sourced from [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/) (Accessed on: 01-03-2023)

Average national income sourced from [The United Nations Development Programme](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI) (Accessed on: 01-03-2023)

Average income data was sourced from the human development index. Gross National Income (GNI) per capita is one measurement of the human development index, a summary measurement of three key dimensions of human development, including healthy life, education and standard of living. 

## **Data Preparation**
Before loading the data, the libraries are loaded and fonts are imported.

### Loading Happiness Data
```{r, Happiness data}
#------------------------------LOADING THE DATA----------------------------------
#Loading happiness data from data folder
Happiness <- read_xls(here("Data", "WorldHappinessReport.xls"))

#Show first few rows of raw data
head(Happiness)
```

### Data Wrangling
The data set includes several variables contributing to the overall measurement of well-being, but for this visualisation, the main focus will be the general life ladder score and the relationship between average national income per capita provided by another data set. Therefore, the variables selected are country, year and life ladder.

The data was filtered to 2011-2021 to focus on 10 years of happiness ratings. This filtered out many missing data points as more countries joined the World Happiness Report in subsequent years.
```{r, data clean 1}
#-------------------------DATA WRANGLING-----------------------------------------
#Creating data frame
HappinessReport = as.data.frame(Happiness)

#Selecting and renaming the variables
HappinessReport <- Happiness %>% 
                   select('Country name', year, 'Life Ladder') %>% #Select old variable names
                   rename(Country = 'Country name', Year = year, #Apply new names 
                          Happiness_Score = 'Life Ladder')

#Filtering years to 2011-2021
HappinessReport <- HappinessReport[HappinessReport$Year >= "2011" & 
                                     HappinessReport$Year <= "2021",]

#Show first few rows of processed data
head(HappinessReport)
```

### Codebook
```{r, codebook1, echo=FALSE}
#Create duplicate data set
HappinessReport2 <- HappinessReport

#Creating descriptive labels for variables
my_labels1 <- c(Country = "Country of the happiness rating",
               Year = "Year that the happiness score was recorded",
               Happiness_Score = "Happiness score based on the Cantril ladder scale, measuring well being as a continuum where 10 is the best possible life, and 0 is the worst possible life")

#Assigning descriptive label to variable
label(HappinessReport2) <- as.list(my_labels1[match(names(HappinessReport2),
                                                    names(my_labels1))])

#Extract labels and form a new dataframe
codebook <- enframe(label(HappinessReport2))

#Rename columns
colnames(codebook) <- c("Variable_ID", "Description")

#Add column for class of variables
codebook <- codebook %>% 
  mutate(Type = map_chr(HappinessReport, class))

#Reorder columns in dataframe
col_order <- c("Variable_ID", "Type", "Description")
codebook <- codebook[, col_order]

#Include table in knitted file with adjusted column width
knitr::kable(codebook) %>% 
  column_spec(1, width = "7em")%>%
    column_spec(2, width = "5em")%>% 
    column_spec(3, width = "55em")
```

## **Visualisation 1: Happiest and Least Happy Countries on Average Between 2011-2021**
For the first visualisation, the average happiness score was calculated for each country to identify which countries are the happiest and the least happy between 2011-2021.

```{r, average}
#--------------------------SUMMARY STATISTICS------------------------------------
#Finding average happiness score of each country
Average <- HappinessReport %>% 
              group_by(Country) %>% #Specify happiness score as column for summary statistics
              summarise_at(vars(Happiness_Score), #Specify summary statistics as computing mean
              list(Happiness_Score = mean)) 
```

### Creating a Bar Chart of The Top 10 Happiest Countries on Average

**Aim 1 = Which countries are the happiest and the least happy?**  
This visualisation shows that 7 out of the top 10 happiest countries are located in Europe, whereas 7 out of the top 10 least happy countries are located in Africa, with roughly half the happiness scores of those located in Europe. This already sheds light on the causes of the difference in happiness scores. With Africa being the poorest continent in the world, this could imply a relationship between money and happiness, reinforcing the motivation for this data visualisation. 

## **Visualisation 2: Choropleth Map of World Happiness 2011-2021**
The second visualisation focuses on how happiness ratings have changed over time during the 10 year period.

There were several missing data points for various countries, but the decision was made not to create averages for these missing points. It was likely that the data was unable to be collected either due to war or natural disaster etc. and therefore, creating an average of surrounding data points for the missing point would not be a true reflection of the happiness score for that year. Consequently, these points have been left blank and show up as grey on the map.  

### Loading The World Map
```{r, map1, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
#---------------------------------PLOTTING WORLD MAP-----------------------------

**Aim 2 = How has happiness changed over the last 10 years?**  
The use of the gradient colour scale ranging from blue (representing sadness) to yellow (representing happiness) shows the substantial variation in happiness ratings across the world. The choropleth map shows that North America, Oceania and Europe have hadnconsistently high happiness ratings over the last 10 years. However, the brightness of the yellow decreases throughout the years, suggesting overall happiness has decreased over this time period. In contrast, there is a lot of inconsistency in scores for countries located in Africa and Asia, made visible by the blue colours as well as the frequent changes in colour. 

## **Visualisation 3: Top 10 Richest and Poorest Countries on Average in 2021**
Next, the average national income per capita data is loaded to visualise the relationship with happiness ratings.

For the purpose of this visualisation and in order to be able to answer the research questions, the average income data set was joined with the happiness report data for 2021, to ensure that only the countries with a happiness rating are plotted. This allows for the relationship between the two variables to be explored. 

### Loading Average Income Data

**Aim 3 = Which countries are the richest and the poorest based on average national income per capita?**  
The decision was made to make the scale the same for both graphs to show the dramatic difference in average income between the top 10 richest countries and the top 10 poorest countries. This graph again shows that 8 out of the top 10 richest countries are in Europe, whilst 9 out of the top 10 poorest countries are in Africa. This is very similar to the happiness rating graphs and, therefore, further indicates a potential relationship between the two variables. By matching the axis scales on both graphs, this visualisation shows the striking difference in average income between the richest and poorest countries. 

## **Visualisation 4: The Relationship Between Average Income and Happiness Score**
The previous visualisations indicate a potential relationship between average income and happiness score. Therefore, the last visualisation includes a scatterplot of the two variables to help identify if there is a relationship between them. 

It is important to note that this visualisation only displays countries which had a happiness rating *and* average income data for 2021 and therefore, interpretation of this visualisation can only be used to assess the relationship of the two variables together and not to assess the richest or happiest country alone i.e., there may have been a country with a greater average income, but if there was no happiness rating for 2021, it was not included in this scatterplot. 

#### Creating scatterplot of average income against happiness score
```{r plot, fig.align='center'}
#Adding column with continent to display colour coded points on the scatterplot
Joined_Data$continent <- countrycode(sourcevar = Joined_Data$Country, #Select country column to be converted
                                     origin = "country.name", #Identify coding scheme of origin
                                     destination = "continent") #Identify wanted coding scheme

#Creating tooltip column for hover text
Joined_Data <- Joined_Data %>% 
                mutate(tooltip_text = paste0(Country, "\n",
                                             "Happiness Score: ", round(Happiness_Score, 3), "\n",
                                              "Average Income: ", dollar(Average.Income)))

#Creating scatterplot - ggiraph package is used to make scatterplot interactive - when mouse hovers over points on the plot, country name, happiness score and average income will be visible
p_both <- ggplot(Joined_Data, aes(Average.Income, Happiness_Score)) + #Apply data as variables to ggplot
          scale_colour_manual(values=c("#FFCC00", "red", "#339000", "black", "#3999FF")) + #Add colours for continent
          geom_point_interactive(aes(col = continent, tooltip = tooltip_text)) + #Make scatterplot with hover text
          #Add logarithmic regression line
          geom_smooth(method="lm", formula= y ~ log(x), se = FALSE, color = "black", size = 0.5) + 
          labs(title = "The Relationship Between Average Income and Happiness Score", #Add labels
               subtitle = "Data from 104 countries in 2021",
               x = "Average Net National Income Per Capita, US($)", 
               y = "Happiness Score",
               caption = "Source: World Happiness Report, United Nations Development Programme",
               color = "Continent") +
           theme(text = element_text(family = "Arial"), #Change font
                 plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"), #Make title bold
                 plot.title.position = "plot") #Move title position

#Saving the plot 
ggsave(here("Figures", "Average Income and Happiness Score.png"), plot = p_both)

#Display interactive graph with girafe() function             
girafe(ggobj = p_both)

```

**Aim 4 = Is there a relationship between average income and overall happiness?**  
Using the Olympic colours to represent each continent, the scatterplot confirms what was found in the previous visualisations, African countries have the lowest incomes and relatively low happiness scores. In comparison, European countries mainly have higher incomes and higher happiness scores. However, the relationship between the two variables does not appear to be linear and therefore, a logarithmic regression line was used to show the relationship. 

## **Summary**
It would seem that money *can* buy happiness but only up to a certain point. The regression line shows a rapid initial increase before beginning to plateau, suggesting that money can make you happy up until a certain point, but after that, increasing your income will have no further effect on happiness. This finding is in support of [Kahneman and Deaton (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1011492107), who found that well-being levels increased with income up until $75,000 before plateauing. [Killingsworth (2021)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/08/money-wealth-happiness-study/) state that, for the most part, larger incomes are associated with greater happiness. However, there is an exception for rich people who are unhappy or depressed, where more money simply does not help. 

### **Limitations and Future Directions**
It is important to consider other contributing factors to happiness scores, as happiness isn't entirely dependent on money. The countries with the lowest happiness ratings are mainly third world countries, whilst the highest rated countries are mostly first world countries, and consequently, there are likely to be many other factors contributing to the happiness scores. Other contributing factors may include war, quality of life, access to healthcare etc. 

The happiness data set included several variables which contributed to the overall happiness score, but due to the time constraints of this module, only the overall happiness score was visualised. Future visualisations using this data could explore the contributors to the happiness score to see which variables had the biggest impact on well-being.
